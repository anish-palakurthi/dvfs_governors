To add one of the custom DVFS governors to your Linux machine, you'll need to follow these steps:

**Prepare your environment:**
Ensure you have the necessary tools to compile kernel modules. On most Linux distributions, you can install these with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

**Choose governor:**
Choose the filename of the governor you want to install.
For the steps, we will use `qlearning.c`, but any filename can be substituted.

**Create a Makefile:**
In the same directory as `qlearning.c`, create a file named `Makefile` with the following content:
```makefile
obj-m += qlearning.o

all:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

**Compile the module:**
Run `make` in the directory containing your `qlearning.c` and `Makefile`.

**Load the module:**
After successful compilation, you can load the module with:
```bash
sudo insmod qlearning.ko
```

**Verify the module is loaded:**
```bash
lsmod | grep qlearning
```

**Use the new governor:**
To use the new governor, you'll need to add it to the list of available governors and then select it:
```bash
echo qlearning | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
echo qlearning | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```
Repeat this for each CPU core you want to control with this governor.

**Important notes:**

- This process requires root privileges.
- The code provided is a basic example and may not work perfectly out of the box. It may need adjustments based on your specific kernel version and hardware.
- Loading custom kernel modules can potentially cause system instability. Always back up your data before experimenting with kernel modules.
- This governor will not persist across reboots unless you set up the module to load automatically at boot time.
- The governor's performance may not be optimal initially, as it needs time to learn and adjust its Q-table.
